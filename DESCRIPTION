Description: omnifocusR lets you bring your OmniFocus data into R with an
    easy to use interface. Task information is extracted from ofocus files, and
    converted into tidy format data frames for plotting and analysis in R. At
    present, omnifocusR focuses (hihi) on retrieving and tidying task and project
    information. NOTE: This package is not owned, developed, maintained, or even
    approved by the OmniGroup or anybody at all related to them. This package is
    provided as is and nobody will take any responsibility if something terrible
    happens to anyone or anything as a result of using this package or not. Enjoy.
