Description:
  omnifocusR lets you bring your OmniFocus data into R with an easy to use interface.
  Task information is extracted from ofocus files, and converted into tidy format data frames
  for plotting and analysis in R. At present, omnifocusR focuses (hihi) on retrieving and tidying
  task and project information.
